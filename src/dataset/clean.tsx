We start with Black Raspberry gelato which is crafted with black raspberry puree that comes from a farm in the Pacific Northwest. Next, we add oat crisps (which are similar to a crunchy oatmeal cookie) and a third layer of Blueberry sauce which is made from all-American blueberries. Finally we add a fourth layer of vanilla gelato and a fifth layer of oat crisps. We think this Black Raspberry Vanilla Parfait is the perfect dessert!",
